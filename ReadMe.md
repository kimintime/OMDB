# OMDB Movie Search
- The OMDB Movie Search app allows the user to search the OMDB for movie or tv shows, the page then displaying the results. The results are shown in groups of not greater than ten for each page. 
- The user can click on each title to see more information. There’s the option to click through the pages of results in their sequential order, or skip to the last page, and scroll back from there, or to skip back to the first page of results.

## Searching for Titles
- If there is no result found for a given search, the page displays “No Result”.
- To execute the search, simply hit enter, or click on the magnifying glass icon.
- A new search can be made at anytime, no need to close or refresh anything.

## Search Results
- Search Results are shown ten at a time. To find out more about a given title, click on its poster, or click on the green More button.
- To go to the next page, click the “Page: X of Y” link.
- To skip to the last page of results, click the “Last Page” link.
- From the second page on, the user may click on “Prev” to go back to the previous page, which works all the way to the front page of results.
- On the last page of results, the user may scroll backwards through the results by clicking the “Prev” link, or skip back to the front page of results.
- Not all titles have posters in the OMDB, and sometimes they’re not a standard size, this is up to the OMDB, but the page will show a default logo for any titles not having a poster.

## Title Information
- When the user clicks a search result poster or the More button, the page scrolls up to display more information about that title. The information supplied is up to the OMDB, but hopefully it is neatly formatted here. Included in the information are the top billed cast and crew, the runtime, it’s parental guidance rating, awards, etc.,
- For more information, click the More link, which will take you to that title’s page over at the IMDB. This is possible because the title’s unique IMDB ID is included in the title’s information at the OMDB.
- Lastly in the title’s information are the ratings at IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. If any other sites are added by OMDB, they should be accounted for in this app, but not all titles have ratings from all three sites.
- To close the information display, simply click the X button, but that is simply user choice.
